1. U16 LMT85DCKR: pin 1 unconnected. output voltage wrong (seems to be in LMT84 mode). used wrong symbol (LM20?). 
Bugfix: connected pin 1 to pin 4(vdd)
Redesign:

2. heater transistor connections wrong.. todo
Bugfix:
Redesign:

3. no onboard pull-up for NRST. connect R between NRST and 3V3 under header? STM32 has internal pull-up. Is this really a bug?
Bugfix:
Redesign:

4. LE# pin of TLV3603 comparators must have pulldown >50k or be left floating! is latched otherwise
Bugfix: lifted pins
Redesign:

5. cal int 100M swing too low to trigger input comparator. increase input threshold to 1.5V or increase swing.
(with R5=220R: cal 100M produces non 50% duty cycle at comparator output. divN not toggling correctly. RF_in levels: 1.23, 1.15V)
Bugfix: R5 -> C 8.2nF seems to work for cal int 100M (R5 -> 220R didn't work well. duty-cycle?)
	TODO Try reducing R45 to 100R (abs max ratings still ok?)
Redesing:

6. Q4 not switching off fast enough due to saturation, storage time (not modelled in spice model)
Use clamping circuit (schottky-Transistor) to avoid Saturation, but keep V_C_on as low as possible.
Bugfix: Q4 -> BFR193, 2xBAT68 in series between Q4.B and Q4.C, C28 -> 10pF. Seems to work!
Redesign: Use BFR193W + 2*BAS40 (a little more VF than BAT68 -> lower V_C -> lower idle offset), 
	optimize R44, R39, C28

7. V_F of D1 varies quite strongly with temperature. Creates temperature dependent Offset
Bugfix: -
Redesign: Use Infineon BAS40, point of very low temperature dependency is around 25 mA.

8. L11 Ferrite for GNSS-Ant not mounted
Bugfix: L11 -> mounted BLM15GG471/AG102?
Redesign:

9. connect cnt_in signal to synchronized signal instead to pulse. enables sampling idle offset on opposite edge
Bugfix:
Redesign:

10. in LO toggles with 100MHz when no input applied. 100M measurable at R5. Ref in comp does not toggle.
Disconnect timepulse from timepulse_hsi and keep gate powered for more isolation.
Unpowered Gate does not provide high isolation!
Bugfix: TODO lift U7.41, connect to U8.1 with wire. unmount R48
Redesign:

11. cal 100M produces non 50% duty cycle at comparator output. divN not toggling correctly. maybe increase R15? Current dc levels: 1.23, 1.15V
Bugfix: TODO Add series C to R5. 
	TODO Try reducing R45 to 100R (abs max ratings still ok?)
Redesign:TODO Add series C to 

12. Obsolete Components: CM1213A-04S7

13. No RC Filter at adc input TAC_out, T_heater

14. stm32 datasheet requires 50% duty cycle HSE clock input. violated by phase shifter. Is 50% really necessary?

15. ADC triggering problematic.
only regular channels can use DMA. Triggering ADC from capture event does not seem to work according to internet: https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus-products/timer4-trigger-for-adc/td-p/507034
Maybe connect pulse or synchronized input to EXTI_11

16. Discharge maybe discharge across diodes and always measure remaining V_CE. Would eliminate leakage problems with diodes (very temperature dependent). VBE-Vschottky is also temp dependent (ca. 1mV/deg for 2*BAT68+BFR193), but less than subthreshold current times cap shunt res. This would eliminate time constant for charging to leakage level. leaving mainly opamp input leakage = 10pA -> shunt res could be increased to make TAC more linear (ADC trigger delay)

17. Wide SMA connectors not readily available from Aliexpress. Redesign for narrow Connectors HI,LO just fit between mounting holes with narrow types.

18. SMA for ANT?

19. Mechanics: ledge feature on bottom part that fits into top not printed. check export, check 3d-view after upload.

20. Mechanics: holes for screws too tight

21. Mechanics: pockets for nuts: hex does not fit into square! make them hex.

22. Display: audible whistling noise
Bugfix: added 150uF tantalum to 12V DC-DC output -> reduced drastically
Todo: test different display configuration

23. Heater controller opamp unstable
Bugfix: cap 8.2n parallel to R63 (tau << R63*C32). done, works.
Redesign: TODO
