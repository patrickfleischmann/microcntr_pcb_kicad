1. U16 LMT85DCKR: pin 1 unconnected. output voltage wrong (seems to be in LMT84 mode). used wrong symbol (LM20?). 
Bugfix: connected pin 1 to pin 4(vdd)
Redesign:

2. heater transistor connections wrong.. todo
Bugfix:
Redesign:

3. no onboard pull-up for NRST. connect R between NRST and 3V3 under header? STM32 has internal pull-up. Is this really a bug?
Bugfix:
Redesign:

4. LE# pin of TLV3603 comparators must have pulldown >50k or be left floating! is latched otherwise
Bugfix: lifted pins
Redesign:

5. cal int 100M swing too low to trigger input comparator. increase input threshold to 1.5V or increase swing.
(with R5=220R: cal 100M produces non 50% duty cycle at comparator output. divN not toggling correctly. RF_in levels: 1.23, 1.15V)
Bugfix: R5 -> C 8.2nF seems to work for cal int 100M (R5 -> 220R didn't work well. duty-cycle?)
	TODO Try reducing R45 to 100R (abs max ratings still ok?)
Redesing:

6. Q4 not switching off fast enough due to saturation, storage time (not modelled in spice model)
Use clamping circuit (schottky-Transistor) to avoid Saturation, but keep V_C_on as low as possible.
Bugfix: Q4 -> BFR193, 2xBAT68 in series between Q4.B and Q4.C, C28 -> 10pF. Seems to work!
Redesign: Use BFR193W + 2*BAS40 (a little more VF than BAT68 -> lower V_C -> lower idle offset), 
	optimize R44, R39, C28

7. V_F of D1 varies quite strongly with temperature. Creates temperature dependent Offset
Bugfix: -
Redesign: Use BAS40, point of very low temperature dependency is around 25 mA.

8. L11 Ferrite for GNSS-Ant not mounted
Bugfix: L11 -> mounted BLM15GG471/AG102?
Redesign:

9. connect cnt_in signal to synchronized signal instead to pulse. enables sampling idle offset on opposite edge
Bugfix:
Redesign:

10. in LO toggles with 100MHz when no input applied. 100M measurable at R5. Ref in comp does not toggle.
Disconnect timepulse from timepulse_hsi and keep gate powered for more isolation.
Unpowered Gate does not provide high isolation!
Bugfix: TODO lift U7.41, connect to U8.1 with wire. unmount R48
Redesign:

11. cal 100M produces non 50% duty cycle at comparator output. divN not toggling correctly. maybe increase R15? Current dc levels: 1.23, 1.15V
Bugfix: TODO Add series C to R5. 
	TODO Try reducing R45 to 100R (abs max ratings still ok?)
Redesign:TODO Add series C to 

12. Obsolete Components: CM1213A-04S7
