1. U16 LMT85DCKR: pin 1 unconnected. output voltage wrong (seems to be in LMT84 mode). used wrong symbol (LM20?). 
bugfix: connect pin 1 to pin 4(vdd)

2. heater transistor connections wrong.. todo

3. no onboard pull-up for NRST. connect R between NRST and 3V3 under header? STM32 has internal pull-up. Is this really a bug?

4. LE# pin of TLV3603 comparators must have pulldown >50k or be left floating! is latched otherwise

5. cal int 100M swing too low to trigger input comparator. increase input threshold to 1.5V or increase swing
